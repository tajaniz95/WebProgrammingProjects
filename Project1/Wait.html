        You cut the ropes off and the bandits are surprised. You attack the one that has your gun and kill him. 
        You take your gun back and start firing at the bandits. The army sees that you're safe and also start 
        firing at the bandits. They have all died, and you make your way towards the army safe and sound. You are
