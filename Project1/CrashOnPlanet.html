        You have crashed onto a deserted planet. You have a few scrapes and bruises but you are in no immediate danger. 
        You get off the ship and further ahead you can see a lone tall building. You have a few options. You can try to 
        send a distress call, stay at the ship and make camp, or search for supplies and go to the tall building.
