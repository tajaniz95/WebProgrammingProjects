        You wake up tied to a chair. There a several men around talking about how they are the ones to crashed your ship. 
        They see that you are awake and tell you that they crashed your ship through an EMP and that other spaceships are 
        now looking for you and are nearing where you crashed. The reason they crashed your ship was to sell your ship's 
        spare parts on the black market, but now that army ships have come looking for you they have decided to take you hostage. 
        They force you to talk to the army ships and tell them that you are safe and are being kidnapped and taken hostage on the 
        planet.
