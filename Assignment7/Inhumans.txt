4. Inhumans - Black Bolt, the enigmatic, commanding head of the Inhuman royal family and King of Attilan, possesses a voice so powerful that the slightest whisper can destroy a city. After a military coup splinters the family, the group -- which includes Black Bolt's wife, Medusa; his brother and rival, Maximus; his cousins Karnak, Gorgon and Triton; and Medusa's sister, Crystal -- barely manages to escape to Hawaii, where surprising interactions with the lush world and humanity around them may prove to not only save them, but Earth itself.
